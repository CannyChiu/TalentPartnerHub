Over the last 6 years, I've really enjoyed partnering with UX, Security, Internal IT, Product, Engineering & Data teams as a Recruiter. By sharing these resources with the world, I hope to empower other Recruiters to be true talent PARTNERS to the businesses they support and ultimately help build life changing products. If you're looking to stay connected, feel free to reach out to [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cannychiu/).

Now that I've spent my first chapter of my talent career honing my recruiting background, I've been intentionally spending my energy expanding my ["T"](https://jchyip.medium.com/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437) and investing in the areas of Diversity & Inclusion, People Analytics, and Total Rewards & Compensation. I've recently moved to a "Full-Stack" HR team at my company where I sit with HR Business Partners. This Github repo will continue to evolve as my own professional interests evolve.
