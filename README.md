I firmly believe in the importance of understanding the business areas/groups that you support as a recruiter. I have included online communities & channels that a technical recruiter can engage & partner with. As always, I believe it's important to acknowledge that these communities are not just used for recruitment so please abide community engagement rules in each respective channel.
