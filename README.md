I find recruiting for Engineering & Product quite different from non-technical roles so I wanted to share some of the resources that I have found useful! If you know of any other interesting resources, please feel free to reach out to me and I will include it below!

Communities:

TechRecruit/TalentCongress: https://www.techrecruit.io/ -> Stacey has built a really great technical recruiting community, I especially love her Dueling Sourcers web series where Sourcers compete and share their tools used for their various hunts!
Recruiting Brainfood: https://www.recruitingbrainfood.com/ -> Love Hung Lee's community, his website contains a great number of global job boards and he has a facebook community + weekly distribution list of thought-provoking talent acquisition articles.
ThePeoplePeopleGroup: https://www.thepeoplepeoplegroup.com/ -> For my Toronto HR folks, PPG is an awesome slack community for networking and resource sharing among Toronto-based Human Resources Professionals
The Sourcing Method by Shally Steckerl: https://www.facebook.com/groups/sourcingmethod -> great for next level sourcing tips!
DiversifyTech: https://www.diversifytech.co/ -> Although not HR related, DiversifyTech is a great hub for inclusion resources, job boards for diverse candidates and events to participate in!
WizardSourcer: https://wizardsourcer.com/tools/ -> Fantastic website/resource for Boolean strings, recruiter templates and deep dives into different technologies used by Recruiters. I tinker around with new tools and this has been a great resource!
Video/E-Learning Resources:

Mozilla Developer Resources - great for understanding frameworks: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Web_frameworks#a_few_good_web_frameworks
WomenWhoCode Technology Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/user/WomenWhoCode -> great videos and content to understand the various aspects of information technology!
Geekruiter Academy: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvfRMDDiKKqNVaezfvBVR0A/videos -> Geekruiter is a fascinating resource, Michal is a former CTO of a start-up that now trains technical recruiters. He delivers various trainings through boot camps, mind maps, booklets, etc. I used alot of his content to understand the various relationships across technologies/languages/frameworks/tools.
Holistica IT Training: https://holistica.co.uk/ -> Ayub is fantastic, I know he's based in the UK and primarily focuses on training technical recruiters. His content covers tech recruiting in development, IT support/infrastructure, data/machine learning + AI! He also wrote an awesome history recap of software development.
LinkedIn Learning: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/ -> I'm a huge fan of LinkedIn Learning - I find it's a great resource for all of the soft skills required for successful recruiting (communication skills, problem solving, data analysis, negotiation, project management, diversity, inclusion & belonging, and more). Some public libraries provide LinkedIn Learning subscriptions so you may be able to get the above resource for free.
AIRS Courses: https://airsdirectory.com/collections/certifications -> When I started in recruiting, I ended up taking both the CIR and PRC certifications through AIRS. Gave great insights on sourcing via Boolean strings and the foundational knowledge of being a Talent Acquisition Partner.
Interesting Whitepapers:

"Never Split the Difference" - Chris Voss -> If you're looking to up your negotiation game, definitely recommend this one
"Work Rules! Insights from Google" - Laszlo Bock -> Super interesting if you're looking to understand some of the human resources methodologies of one of the biggest global technology companies in the world

Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track by Will Larson: https://staffeng.com/book -> I just started this book, but I loved the insights of developers on the technical track. As a recruiter, it's always interesting to see the career pathing of developers in addition to getting a sense of how other R&D groups are structured
